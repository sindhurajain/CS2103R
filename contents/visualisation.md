## Visualisation of Tasks in Different Formats
Each view caters to different aspects of project management, allowing teams to choose the best way to
visualise their tasks based on their needs.

* Board View provides a column-based layout for managing tasks. Tasks, which are usually issues or pull requests are
visually represented as cards and can be moved between columns to reflect their status
(e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). This View is best for visualising task progression.

* Table View presents project tasks in a spreadsheet-like format. Tasks are listed in rows, with customizable columns
displaying different attributes (e.g., title, status, assignee, labels, due dates). It allows for sorting and
filtering of tasks based on various criteria. This View is best for detailed task management
and providing a structured overview of all tasks.

* Roadmap view provides a timeline-based representation of tasks, helping with planning and tracking tasks both across
and within milestones. Tasks are shown on a chronological timeline, with start and end dates.
This View is best for long-term planning and tracking the alignment of tasks with deadlines.

By configuring the layout, you can customise the fields visible for each task, edit the name of each View,
slice by field, sort by field, etc.

Tips for team projects:
<br>
- Sort by a particular field to prioritise tasks by that field. 
<br>
For example: Add start date and end date custom fields. Sort by end date in ascending order to make it easier to
prioritise tasks by deadline.
<br>
- Slice by milestone to segment the View by milestone. This allows for automated tracking of tasks within 
each milestone.
<br>
- Useful "Status" categories to add include: Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Needs PR Review, Done 
and Up Next in v1.x
