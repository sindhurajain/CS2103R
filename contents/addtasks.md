## Add Tasks to Project Board

Upon creating the Project Board, you should be able to see the View page,
depending on the View you selected, as shown in the diagrams below.

Board View:

Table View:

Roadmap View:

Once you have the Project Board set up,
you can add <tooltip content="Tasks are usually issues or pull requests."
placement="top">Tasks</tooltip> to the Project Board.

Click on the "Add item" button to either create a new issue or add an item
from a repository.

If you are adding a new issue, fill in the title and description, then click on the
"Create" button.

If you are adding an item from a repository, select one or more available issues or
pull requests from the dropdown list, then click on the "Add selected items" button
to add it to the View.

tP tip:
<br>
While a Project Board can display issues or pull requests from multiple repositories, it is better 
to add issues or pull requests from only your group's forked tP repository to your group's tP Project Board 
so that you can maintain a more focused view. 
<br>
<br>
This ensures that all the issues and pull requests you're tracking are relevant to your specific fork, 
simplifying management of the tasks your group has to complete.
</box>

Like any other issue created on GitHub, you can click on the issue on the View page and to manage it.
This includes assigning it to a user, adding labels, setting milestones, and more.

If you have multiple Views in the Project Board, the tasks you have added to any View in the Project Board will
be added to all Views in the Project Board. For example, if I add 2 tasks to the Board View, the same 2 tasks
will also appear in the Table View and Roadmap View.
