## Adding Fields to Tasks

To add fields to tasks, click on the "..." button in the top right corner of the View page, then click on "Settings".

"Status" is a default field for the Board View, which can be modified using the "Add option..." button.
For example, I can add another option called "Up Next" so that a task can have a status of "Up Next".
Custom fields can also be added by clicking on "New field".

For example, I can add a custom field called "Start Date" of type `Date` to a task.

</pic>

Other useful custom fields that can be added include:
* "End Date" of type `Date`
* "Estimated Completion Hours" of type `Number`

To delete a custom field, select the field you want to delete on the left menu bar, then click the "Delete field"
button at the top right corner.

Similarly, for Table View, you can add a column with the custom field.

And you can change the value of the custom field for each task by clicking on the corresponding cell.
