## Automated Insights

Clicking on the "Insights" button in the top right corner of any View page will bring you to the Insights page.

tP tips:
<br>
A useful custom chat to create would be a bar graph of the number of tasks grouped by assignee. The y-axis in
this case would be "Count of items" and the x-axis would be "Assignees".
<br>
<br>
This allows your tP group to track the workload distribution of tasks and ensure that it is roughly even
so that no teammate is overloaded with work.
<br>
<br>
You can also configure the chart to Group by "Labels" to ensure that each teammate has the chance to contribute
to different areas of software development, like bug fixing, documentation and feature enhancements.
