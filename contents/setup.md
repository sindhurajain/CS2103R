## Add Tasks to Project Board

Upon creating the Project Board, you should be able to see the View page, 
depending on the View you selected, as shown in the diagrams below.

Board View:

Roadmap View:

</pic>

Once you have the Project Board set up,
you can add <tooltip content="Tasks are usually issues or pull requests."
placement="top">Tasks</tooltip> to the Project Board.

Click on the "Add item" button to either create a new issue or add an item
from a repository.

If you are adding a new issue, fill in the title and description, then click on the
"Create" button.
<br>
<pic src="/images/new-issue.png" width="700" alt="Add new issue">

</pic>
<br>

If you are adding an item from a repository, select one or more available issues or 
pull requests from the dropdown list, then click on the "Add selected items" button
to add it to the View.

If you have multiple Views in the Project Board, the tasks you have added to any View in the Projcet Board will
be added to all Views in the Project Board. For example, if I add 2 tasks to the Board View, the same 2 tasks
will also appear in the Table View and Roadmap View.

## FAQ

**Q1: What is the difference between Board View, Table View, and Roadmap View?**
<br>
<br>
A: Each view caters to different aspects of project management, allowing teams to choose the best way to 
visualise their tasks based on their needs.

Board View provides a column-based layout for managing tasks. Tasks, which are usually issues or pull requests are
visually represented as cards and can be moved between columns to reflect their status 
(e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). This View is best for visualising task progression.

Table View presents project tasks in a spreadsheet-like format. Tasks are listed in rows, with customizable columns 
displaying different attributes (e.g., title, status, assignee, labels, due dates). It allows for sorting and 
filtering of tasks based on various criteria. This View is best for detailed task management
and providing a structured overview of all tasks.

Roadmap view provides a timeline-based representation of tasks, helping with planning and tracking tasks both across and
within milestones. Tasks are shown on a chronological timeline, with start and end dates. 
This View is best for long-term planning and tracking the alignment of tasks with deadlines

**Q2: Can I choose more than one View?**
